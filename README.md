Implemented the application "cizgic" to understand computer graphics fundamentals without any graphics library like opengl etc.

It "draws" a shape on the screen by creating PPM image files with prepared pixel buffer. The reason I chose PPM image file is
because it's format is relatively easier than the alternatives.

I don't care how C code looks like in this project since it is not my main purpose, so feel free to roast me!
